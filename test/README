Testing
=======

Unit Tests
----------
I've started writing unit tests when bugs are encountered.
The tests are written using UnitTest, and can be run as follows:

```python
cd compass
nosetests
```

Most of the tests are checking against JSON output. Where
reasonably small I have inlined the expected result in the
testcases, but in certain cases I've included them as files in
the `expectations` directory.

Regression Tests
----------------

These are a set of scripts designed to make sure that changes to
the command line version of `compass.py` don't result in
different output than before. They're not pretty, but they work.

`test.sh` will run a series of command line switches
at `compass.py`, and save the output in a series of named test 
files.
`check.py` will take two test names and compare the output
from those tests to see if they match.

*Note:* Sometimes a test will fail even though the output is correct
because the sorting works differently in my revised version and
elements with the same value don't always occur in the same order.
